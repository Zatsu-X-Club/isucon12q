.SH "NAME"
pt\-fingerprint \- Convert queries into fingerprints.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Usage: pt-fingerprint [\s-1OPTIONS\s0] [\s-1FILES\s0]
.PP
pt-fingerprint converts queries into fingerprints.  With the \-\-query
option, converts the option's value into a fingerprint.  With no options, treats
command-line arguments as FILEs and reads and converts semicolon-separated
queries from the FILEs. When \s-1FILE\s0 is \-, it read standard input.
.PP
Convert a single query:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  pt\-fingerprint \-\-query "select a, b, c from users where id = 500"
.Ve
.PP
Convert a file full of queries:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  pt\-fingerprint /path/to/file.txt
.Ve
.SH "RISKS"
.IX Header "RISKS"
Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Read the tool's documentation
.IP "\(bu" 4
Review the tool's known \*(L"\s-1BUGS\*(R"\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Test the tool on a non-production server
.IP "\(bu" 4
Backup your production server and verify the backups
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A query fingerprint is the abstracted form of a query, which makes it possible
to group similar queries together.  Abstracting a query removes literal values,
normalizes whitespace, and so on.  For example, consider these two queries:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  SELECT name, password FROM user WHERE id=\*(Aq12823\*(Aq;
\&  select name,   password from user
\&     where id=5;
.Ve
.PP
Both of those queries will fingerprint to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  select name, password from user where id=?
.Ve
.PP
Once the query's fingerprint is known, we can then talk about a query as though
it represents all similar queries.
.PP
Query fingerprinting accommodates a great many special cases, which have proven
necessary in the real world.  For example, an \s-1IN\s0 list with 5 literals is really
equivalent to one with 4 literals, so lists of literals are collapsed to a
single one.  If you want to understand more about how and why all of these cases
are handled, please review the test cases in the Subversion repository.  If you
find something that is not fingerprinted properly, please submit a bug report
with a reproducible test case.  Here is a list of transformations during
fingerprinting, which might not be exhaustive:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Group all \s-1SELECT\s0 queries from mysqldump together, even if they are against
different tables.  Ditto for all of pt-table-checksum's checksum queries.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Shorten multi-value \s-1INSERT\s0 statements to a single \s-1\fBVALUES\s0()\fR list.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Strip comments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Abstract the databases in \s-1USE\s0 statements, so all \s-1USE\s0 statements are grouped
together.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Replace all literals, such as quoted strings.  For efficiency, the code that
replaces literal numbers is somewhat non-selective, and might replace some
things as numbers when they really are not.  Hexadecimal literals are also
replaced.  \s-1NULL\s0 is treated as a literal.  Numbers embedded in identifiers are
also replaced, so tables named similarly will be fingerprinted to the same
values (e.g. users_2009 and users_2010 will fingerprint identically).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Collapse all whitespace into a single space.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Lowercase the entire query.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Replace all literals inside of \s-1\fBIN\s0()\fR and \s-1\fBVALUES\s0()\fR lists with a single
placeholder, regardless of cardinality.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Collapse multiple identical \s-1UNION\s0 queries into a single one.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the
\&\*(L"\s-1SYNOPSIS\*(R"\s0 and usage information for details.
.IP "\-\-config" 4
.IX Item "--config"
type: Array
.Sp
Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the
first option on the command line.
.IP "\-\-help" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Show help and exit.
.IP "\-\-match\-embedded\-numbers" 4
.IX Item "--match-embedded-numbers"
Match numbers embedded in words and replace as single values.  This option
causes the tool to be more careful about matching numbers so that words
with numbers, like \f(CW\*(C`catch22\*(C'\fR are matched and replaced as a single \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR
placeholder.  Otherwise the default number matching pattern will replace
\&\f(CW\*(C`catch22\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`catch?\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This is helpful if database or table names contain numbers.
.IP "\-\-match\-md5\-checksums" 4
.IX Item "--match-md5-checksums"
Match \s-1MD5\s0 checksums and replace as single values.  This option causes
the tool to be more careful about matching numbers so that \s-1MD5\s0 checksums
like \f(CW\*(C`fbc5e685a5d3d45aa1d0347fdb7c4d35\*(C'\fR are matched and replaced as a
single \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR placeholder.  Otherwise, the default number matching pattern will
replace \f(CW\*(C`fbc5e685a5d3d45aa1d0347fdb7c4d35\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`fbc?\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-\-query" 4
.IX Item "--query"
type: string
.Sp
The query to convert into a fingerprint.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Show version and exit.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
The environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PTDEBUG\*(C'\fR enables verbose debugging output to \s-1STDERR.\s0
To enable debugging and capture all output to a file, run the tool like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   PTDEBUG=1 pt\-fingerprint ... > FILE 2>&1
.Ve
.PP
Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes
of output.
.SH "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
.IX Header "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
You need Perl, \s-1DBI,\s0 DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be
installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.
